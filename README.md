# mesh-social

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Moment.js to format timestamps. The seed data is created using Insomnia.
